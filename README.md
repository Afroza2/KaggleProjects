# KaggleProjects


This repository will contain all the Colab notebooks of my team's Kaggle competitions. My team name is Bulbasaur, therefore, it's the repository of the good boi Bulbasaur. Team Bulbasaur started from February, 2022, with Afroza Nowshin (Senjuti), Amimul Ihsan Zami and Marjan Ferdousi Orthy.

Zami and I are learning to apply deep learning based solution to WiDS Datathon with the help of our kitty sensei Marjan Ferdousi Orthy.

Eventually, we will take part in a number of Kaggle and data sciene related competitons in order to strenghten our knowledge about the topics.
